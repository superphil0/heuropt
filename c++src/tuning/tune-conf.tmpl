## Configuration for Iterated Race (iRace).
############################################################################

## To use the default value of a parameter of iRace, simply do not set
## the parameter (comment it out in this file, and do not give any
## value on the command line).

## File that contains the description of the parameters.
# parameterFile = "./parameters.txt"

## Directory where the programs will be run.
# execDir = "./"

## File to save tuning results as an R dataset, either absolute path
## or relative to execDir.
# logFile = "./irace.Rdata"

## Directory where tuning instances are located, either absolute path or
## relative to current directory.
# instanceDir = "./Instances"

## File with a list of instances and (optionally) parameters.
## If empty or NULL, do not use a file.
# instanceFile = ""

## A file containing a list of initial candidates. 
## If empty or NULL, do not use a file.
# candidatesFile = ""

## The script called for each candidate that launches the program to be tuned. 
## See templates/hook-run.tmpl
 hookRun = "./hook-run.bat"

## Optional R function to provide custom parallelization of hook.run.  The
## signature of this function should be 'function(experiments, hook.run,
## config)', where hook.run is an R function, 'experiments' is a list such that
## each of its elements will be the argument to one call of hook.run, and
## config will also be passed to every call. See help(hook.run.default) for
## details.
# hookRunParallel = NULL

## Optional script that provides a numeric value for each candidate.
## See templates/hook-evaluate.tmpl
# hookEvaluate = ""

## The maximum number of runs (invocations of hookRun) that will performed. It
## determines the (maximum) budget of experiments for the tuning, unless
## timeBudget is positive.
# maxExperiments = 1000

## The maximum computation time that should be used for tuning in
## seconds. This only works when tuning for time. 0 means no time
## limit (use maxExperiments).
# timeBudget = 0

## An estimation of the average time in seconds required for one
## experiment. Only required if timeBudget is positive.
# timeEstimate = 0

## Directory where testing instances are located, either absolute or relative
## to current directory.
# testInstanceDir = ""

## File containing a list of test instances and optionally additional
## parameters for them.  If empty or NULL, do not use a file.
# testInstanceFile = ""

## Number of elite candidates returned by irace that will be tested.
# testNbElites = 0

## Enable/disable testing the elite candidates found at each iteration.
# testIterationElites = 0

## Indicates the number of decimal places to be considered for the
## real parameters.
# digits = 4

## A value of 0 silences all debug messages. Higher values provide
## more verbose debug messages.
# debugLevel = 0

## Number of iterations of Race. Do not use something else than the
## default (that is, the dynamic value) unless you know exactly what
## you are doing.
# nbIterations = 0

## Number of experiments per iteration. Do no use something else than
## the default (that is, the dynamic value) unless you know exactly
## what you are doing.
# nbExperimentsPerIteration = 0

## Sample the instances or take them always in the same order.
# sampleInstances = 1

## Specifies the statistical test type: F-test or t-test.
# testType = "F-test"

## Specifies how many instances are seen before the first elimination
## test. It must be a multiple of eachTest.
# firstTest = 5

## Specifies how many instances are seen between elimination tests.
# eachTest = 1

## The minimum number of candidates that should survive to continue one
## iteration. Do not use something else than the default (that is, the
## dynamic value) unless you know exactly what you are doing.
# minNbSurvival = 0

## The number of candidates that should be sampled and evaluated at
## each iteration. Do no use something else than
## the default (that is, the dynamic value) unless you know exactly
## what you are doing.
# nbCandidates  = 0

## This value is used to determine the number of candidates
## to be sampled and evaluated at each iteration. Use
## the default unless you know exactly what you are doing.
# mu = 5

## Seed of the random number generator (must be a positive integer, NA
## means use a random seed).
# seed = NA

## Number of calls to hookRun to execute in parallel. Less than 2
# means calls to hookRun are sequentially executed.
# parallel = 0

## Enable/disable load-balancing when executing experiments in
## parallel. Load-balancing makes better use of computing resources, but
## increases communication overhead. If this overhead is large, disabling
## load-balancing may be faster.
# loadBalancing = 1

## Enable/disable SGE cluster mode. Use qstat to wait for
## cluster jobs to finish (hookRun must invoke qsub).
# sgeCluster = 0

## Enable/disable MPI. Use MPI to execute hookRun in parallel
## (parameter parallel is the number of slaves).
# mpi = 0

## Enable/disable the soft restart strategy that avoids premature convergence
## of the probabilistic model.
# softRestart = 1

## Confidence level for the elimination test.
# confidence = 0.95

## Previously saved log file to recover the execution of irace, either
## absolute path or relative to the current directory. If empty or
## NULL, recovery is not performed.
# recoveryFile = ""

## File containing a list of logical expressions that cannot be true
## for any evaluated candidate. If empty or NULL, do not use a file.
# forbiddenFile = ""

## END of configuration file
